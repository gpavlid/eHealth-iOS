This is a complete XCode project for an iOS app that is able to connect to a web server and fetch and display Health data

Take a look at the original post for this project @ http://georgepavlides.info/ehealth-made-simple/

This version of the app has already been published on the App Store @ https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/i-health/id928539620
*** the developer account is currently suspended, so you might not be able to find the app on the Store ***

There is a test server publising random (somehow realistic) JSON encoded data @ http://ihealth.sepdek.net 

The project is compatible with the ‘e-Health sensor platform kit’
